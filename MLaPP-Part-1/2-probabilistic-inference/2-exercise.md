### 2.1 [Bayes rule for medical diagnosis]

After your yearly checkup, the doctor has bad news and good news. The bad news is that you tested positive for a serious disease, and that the test is 99% accurate (i.e., the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease is 0.99, as is the probability of testing negative given that you don’t have the disease). The good news is that this is a rare disease, striking only one in 10,000 people. What are the chances that you actually have the disease? (Show your calculations as well as giving the ﬁnal result.) 

### Answer : 0.09% -[ ]

### 2.2 [Legal reasoning]

(Source: Peter Lee.) Suppose a crime has been committed. Blood is found at the scene for which there is no innocent explanation. It is of a type which is present in 1% of the population.

- a. The prosecutor claims: “There is a 1% chance that the defendant would have the crime blood type if he were innocent. Thus there is a 99% chance that he is guilty”. This is known as the prosecutor’s fallacy. What is wrong with this argument? 

- b. The defender claims: “The crime occurred in a city of 800,000 people. The blood type would be found in approximately 8000 people. The evidence has provided a probability of just 1 in 8000 that the defendant is guilty, and thus has no relevance.” This is known as the defender’s fallacy. What is wrong with this argument?

### 2.3 [Probabilities are sensitive to the form of the question that was used to generate the answer]

(Source: Minka.) My neighbor has two children. Assuming that the gender of a child is like a coin ﬂip, it is most likely, a priori, that my neighbor has one boy and one girl, with probability 1/2. The other possibilities—two boys or two girls—have probabilities 1/4 and 1/4.

- a. Suppose I ask him whether he has any boys, and he says yes. What is the probability that one child is a girl? 

- b. Suppose instead that I happen to see one of his children run by, and it is a boy. What is the probability that the other child is a girl?

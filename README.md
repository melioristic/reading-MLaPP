# reading-MLaPP
This place brings together some information about people who are reading Machine Learning a Probabilisitic Perspective (MLaPP) book. (1st Edition, 2nd edition is supposed to be out in 2021). The repo also contains a tentative schedule, while the general idea is to read 1 chapter per week. The reading can be paced by the readers as per their preference.

### Schedule Sprint 1
